				<h4>Choose Your Own Murder Mystery</h4>
				<div class="content">
					<img class="screenshot" src="CYOA.png" alt="">
					<p>Enter the mansion and let your decisions take you on a journey... though you may not make it out alive! Try not to use the Back button. If you perish you can replay the story and discover one of the other many endings. Add your name and ending to the Leaderboard after each time you complete the story. Written by me and planned with Twine. Made with postgreSQL, Ruby, HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.

				<h4>Where [over] the world is the ISS?</h4>
				<div class="content">
					<img class="screenshot" src="iss.png" alt="">
					<p>A place where you can see what the ISS is up to! It orbits the Earth once every 90 minutes or so. You can track where the ISS is located (lat and lon); which country it is over right now; and that country's flag. You can also see when it will next be over your exact location, and who is aboard the ISS currently. Built with React, and using Open Notify, GeoNames, and CountryFlags.io APIs. Fuelled by a love of space and a desire to learn.
